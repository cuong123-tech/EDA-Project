#COVID-19 EDA Project

Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights. The analysis focuses on metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other related factors across geographic regions.

The project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. Results are presented through charts and summary reports.

Objectives





Understand the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths across regions.



Identify patterns or relationships in the data, such as correlations between control measures and case numbers.



Provide clear visualizations to support decision-making or further research.

Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available repositories, such as:





Our World in Data



Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository



WHO COVID-19 Dashboard

The dataset files are stored in the data/ directory.
Objectives





Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.



Explore distributions and relationships of key variables (age, sex, class, etc.).



Visualize trends using charts (histograms, box plots, heatmaps).



Derive actionable insights to support predictive modeling.
