# COVID-19 EDA Project

## Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights. The analysis focuses on metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other related factors across geographic regions.

The project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. Results are presented through charts and summary reports.
## Objectives

Understand the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths across regions.

Identify patterns or relationships in the data, such as correlations between control measures and case numbers. 

Provide clear visualizations to support decision-making or further research.
## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available repositories, such as:
[Our World in Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/82wn58ry9p/1)
## Usage

### Data Cleaning:

Run cleaning.ipynb to preprocess the raw data and save cleaned datasets in data/processed/.
### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Open eda_analysis.ipynb to explore the data and identify trends or patterns.
### Visualizations:

Use visualizations.ipynb to generate charts and save them in results/figures/.
### Results

Key findings and visualizations are saved in the results/ directory:

Figures: Charts such as time-series plots, heatmaps, and bar charts.

Reports: Summary statistics and insights in markdown.
## Tools Used

Programming Language: Python.

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
